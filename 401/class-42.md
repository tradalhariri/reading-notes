## Reflections on Ethics in the workplace

A good developer should always be aware of the consequences of their apps and programs, and the services they provide. Employers should provide clear, contracts and conditions to their employees, of their responsibilities, authorities and rights.

Some technologies can be utilized by malicious groups, so releasing it to the public should be carefully considered and studied. If they cannot directly refuse to work on a harmful or unethical project, the least they can do is protest it and make their concerns heard from their employers.

## Reflections on Ethics in Technology

Machines are good at computing countless things; value of a human being is not one of them. People's lives should not be completely entrusted to mere trial and error programs to handle.

Technology users should be made aware of how much data does the things they use collect and use off them. How is it collected, handled, stored, to whom it is distributed and shared with? And how can they ask for it to be removed or deleted at any given point. How does it benefit them or help in making their experience better in reality?
