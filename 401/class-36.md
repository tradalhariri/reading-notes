# The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received


## The Advice: Communicate!

- The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate!


## First, Restate the Question

- Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it.

- Restate the question for them and seek affirmation.

- You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for—perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

- The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand.

- Furthermore, starting the discussion this way will help quell some nerves that might otherwise manifest while trying to solve the actual challenge.

## Ask About Edge Cases

> hink for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.
> In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up.

## Ask About Test Cases

- This is free and you should take advantage of it.
* Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.
- Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. 

## Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

* Let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.

* (Coincidentally, this is a reasonable way to write actual code as well).

- You can ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer.

- In the worst case the interviewer will tell you to continue without actually offering feedback.

* In the best case, the interviewer might actually point out logical flaws in your pseudocode that will give you some serious benefit when transitioning to actual code.

## Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

- You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code.

- You don’t even need to remove the comments.

* At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.

* If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief.

* If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

## Stuck? Ask for Help!

- If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. 

## Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview

> You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview.
> Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them!
> They might tell you whether you’ll be sitting at a computer or standing at a whiteboard—very useful information you might be able to use to practice or, at the very least, mentally prepare.

## We’re All Human

- Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview.
- Your interviewer has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner.

## Take a few minutes

1. Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews.

2. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”.

3. Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
4.  Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions
5.  Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach.
6.  Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded.
## Write down the steps of the solution

1. Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down.
2. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.
3. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.

## Write pseudocode first

- Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode.
- Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away.
- write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work
- Even if we never make it to writing code, many interviewers will consider this a solution to the problem.
## Don’t sweat the small stuff

1. Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet.
2. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities.
3. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.
4. Half of being a programmer is knowing how to Google stuff and how to interpret search results. 

## Sit down. Be humble
> A programming interview isn’t just a written exam.
> It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.
> If you are given criticism in an interview, you need to take it and be grateful for it.'

## Come prepared

- When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat).
-  It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards.
-  In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

## Review your work
> You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution.
If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”.
Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review.

- In particular, focus on these two areas, as they receive heavy scrutiny in interviews:
  - Algorithmic efficiency
    - Have you found the fastest and most optimal solution given the requirements?
    - Take some time and consider other approaches.
  - Correctness
    - Sure, you’ve solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases? Off-by-one errors? Issues with negative numbers or empty arrays or missing keys or strings with weird patterns of characters?
