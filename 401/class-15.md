# Trees

## Common Terminology 


* Node : A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes

* Root : The root is the node at the beginning of the tree 

* K : A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

* Left :A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

* Right :A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

* Edge :the edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

* Leaf :A leaf is a node that does not have any children

* Height :The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### traversals

**Traverse an tree meaning how to reach each node of it ,how to print it and do more** 

> Depth First : in depth first we traverse the tree with preoritize to dive in hight of tree (depth)

1. Pre-order: root >> left >> right
2. In-order: left >> root >> right
3. Post-order: left >> right >> root



4. Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
5. In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
6. Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A

### Traversal Pseudocode Depth First

```
- Pre-order 

        ALGORITHM preOrder(root)
        // INPUT <-- root node
        // OUTPUT <-- pre-order output of tree node's values

            OUTPUT <-- root.value

            if root.left is not Null
                preOrder(root.left)

            if root.right is not NULL
                preOrder(root.right) 

- In-order 

        ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
        // INPUT <-- root node
        // OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

            if root.left is not NULL
                inOrder(root.left)

            OUTPUT <-- root.value

            if root.right is not NULL
                inOrder(root.right)

- Post-order 

        ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
        // INPUT <-- root node
        // OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

            if root.left is not NULL
                postOrder(root.left)

            if root.right is not NULL
                postOrder(root.right)

            OUTPUT <-- root.value

```
> Breadth First : 

**traverse the tree with traverse each level first before going to the next level** 

![Breadth First](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/tree-example.png) 

### Pseudocode breadth first
```
        ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
        // INPUT  <-- root node
        // OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

        Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
        breadth.enqueue(root)

        while breadth.peek()
            node front = breadth.dequeue()
            OUTPUT <-- front.value

            if front.left is not NULL
            breadth.enqueue(front.left)

            if front.right is not NULL
            breadth.enqueue(front.right) 
```
## Binary Tree and K-ary Trees 

**Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).**

**There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.**

> K-ary Trees 

**If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.** 

### Breadth First Traversal

**Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth first traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down a list of children of length k, instead of checking for the presence of a left and a right child.**

![K-ary Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/KaryTree1.png)

### Pseudocode 

**This process is very similar to our binary tree traversal, but now we check a list of children instead of a left and right child properties. It should look something like this:** 

        ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
        // INPUT  <-- root node
        // OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

        Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
        breadth.enqueue(root)

        while breadth.peek()
            node front = breadth.dequeue()
            OUTPUT <-- front.value

            for child in front.children
                breadth.enqueue(child)

### Adding a node

**One strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down. To do so, we would leverage the use of breadth first traversal. During the traversal, we find the first node that does not have all it’s children filled, and insert the new node as a child. We fill the child slots from left to right.** 

### Big O

* **The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n).** 

* **The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree.** 

> Binary Search Trees : 

**A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.** 

![Binary Search Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/BST1.PNG) 

### Searching a BST 

**Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.** 

### Big O 

* **The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.** 

* **The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1). During a search, we are not allocating any additional space.**
