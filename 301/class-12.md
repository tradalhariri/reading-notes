## Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
| SQL                                                                 | NoSQL       |
| -----------         | ----------- |
| SQL databases are table basesd where we can store the data in tables.each table contains numbers of rows      |  NoSQL databases are document based where we can store the datd as key value pairs |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable which means if we need to increase the performance we can upgrade the server hardware(CPU,RAM,etc...)   | NoSQL databases are horzentally scalable which means if we need to increase the performance we can increase the numbers of  servers  |
| SQL databases have predefined schema   | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema        |
| Excellent support is available from vendors of SQL databases   | where as in NoSQL databases developers should depend on community support  |
| In SQL databases there is a relations between tables    | In NoSQl there is not a relation concept at all because the data is stored as unstructured data |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
if the data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined.
## Give a real world example.
developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records.
## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
hierarchical data
## Give a real world example.
data from social media analysis and websites
## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL databases.
## Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases.

## What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
## What is a realational database?
A relational database is a collection of data items (tables) that has a predefined relationship between them
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
a relational database work with tables structure.
## What is a ‘schema’?
`Schema` is predefined structure to normalize how the data should be added to the table. in SQL it should be follow a standard schema  for each table.
## What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL database is a database type where there is no relations between groups of data.
## Howo does it work?
NoSQL databases do not rely on relational structures and use more flexible data models l(collections and documents)
## What is inside of a Mongo database?
There are collections inside Mongo database and inside each collection there are documents (objects) to represent the data 
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
NoSQL is more flexible because it dose not adhere to a predefined schema
## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
one of the most disadvantage of NoSQL is you need to update documents in multiple places if the user update one in one place.
