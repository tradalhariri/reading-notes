* The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’ : after years of studying Google teams the  researchers found that there were four key characteristics of enhanced teams:

1. Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
2. Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
3. Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
4. Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.
  
* the researchers found also that the poorest-performing teams were 0 percent ‘relationship-building’ traits.
