# An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com


## What is node.js?
Node.js is an event-driven, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O (input/output) javascript runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript Engine.
## In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome V8 is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) enhanced V8 and added some features like file system API and Http module.

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. By enhancing V8 engine then we can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser(we can now execute javascript on our computer)
In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## What is npm?
 npm stands for node package manager. it is a package manager of javascript. It is also the world’s largest software registry. this registry contains thousands of code packages that developers can use them.
## What version of node are you running on your machine?
`v14.17.4`
## What version of npm are you running on your machine?
`6.14.14`
## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
`npm install -g jshint`  to install it globally  
`npm init -y`  then `npm install jshint --save` to install it locally inside a specific project.
## What is node used for?

* we can use node for building modern front end applications using React for example. This is because the react and its related packages rely on node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.
* we can use it to run javascript code on server. 


# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?


* Greater efficiency : when two developers focus on the same problem the will reach a solution faster than if there is a one developer.also the code that is written by pair programming takes less time when they decide to maintain later.

* Engaged collaboration : when you feel that someone depends on you to complete a task then you will do better than if you were alone.

* Learning from fellow students : each developer has own approch in problem solving. when you working in pair programming you may expose other techniques to other developers.

* Social skills : pair programming improves not only social skills with others but also it improves the interpersonal skills .

* Job interview readiness : pair programming is a better way to preparing the developer for the job interview as the employer can feel how the applicant can fit in a team.

* Work environment readiness : many companies expect to training the fresh hired employees but the pair programming developer dose not need that.

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

`Greater efficiency` since the mistakes can be found faster and the process of development is faster than traditional way.

## How does pair programming work?
In this methodology there are two developers first one is called driver who is responsible on writing the code and handl text editor files and version control. while the the second one is called teh navigator who is responsible on guid the driver and check the bug and thinking in the optimal solution but he dose not touch the keyboard.
