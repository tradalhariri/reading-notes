## MarkDown

### Markdown is a way to style text on web. By using it you can format text as bold or italic, inset images, create lists and more things.


### Examples:
1. `**using 2 stars before and after the sentence produces a bold format of that sentence **` :arrow_right:  **using 2 stars before and after the sentence produces a bold format of that sentence**
2. `*using 1 star before and after the sentence produces an italic format of that sentence *` :arrow_right:  *using 1 star before and after the sentence produces an italic format of that sentence*
3. we can use syntax highlighting to inset a code in a specific language like javascript without indent by four spaces.
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
4. To insert an image we use  this format `![Image Title](image url)`
