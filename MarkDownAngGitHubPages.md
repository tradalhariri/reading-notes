## MarkDown

### Markdown is a way to style text on web. By using it you can format text as bold or italic, inset images, create lists and more things.


* Examples:
1. `**after the sentence make the sentence becomes bold**`:arrow_right: **after the sentence make the sentence becomes bold**
2. *using one star `*` before and after the sentence the sentence becomes italic*
3. > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
